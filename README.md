##Short Answer questions 
###1. What are the most important aspects of quality software?

####Functionality, structural quality and the process of development for apps greatly contribute to creating quality software.

####Functionality is defined as how easy the app is to use. In consumer applications, if the app has a well defined user workflow, complete with a good aesthetic, the consumer will be more inclined to use said app.  If an app has a convoluted workflow, regardless of its aesthetics, it will prevent the user from utilising the apps full functionality.  

####A way to ensure the functionality of an application can be through writing automate tests for the app. This will assist in identifying any issues that can occur when a user is operating the app. 

####Testing your application also leads to developing a structural quality in the code.  

####By making sure the code is readable and understandable for others can make the application flow from legacy code to new written code with little confusion.   
####Having a strong structure for the code also assists in developing security for the app. 

####Developing code that guards against accidental security vulnerabilities such as logic flaws or defects can be helped by identifying previous flaws and taking proactive steps that can reduce the vulnerabilities.  

####Lastly, the quality of the development process will affect the longevity of the app. By making the app development process repeatable will ensure that there can be further iterations of the product or future developments on it. A repeatable development process includes the project management of the app, such as meeting deadlines and budgets. 

###2. What libraries are being used in the app and why?
###3. A team is about to engage in a project, developing a website for a small business. What knowledge and skills would they need in order to develop the project?
###4. Within your own project what knowledge or skills were required to complete your project, and overcome challenges?
###5.Evaluate how effective your knowledge and skills were this project, using examples, and suggest changes or improvements for future projects of a similar nature?
